These minimal examples shows how to create a ssl context plus a client & server.
For debug purposes 'std::string' is used, but it is highly recommended to use a serializer instead of using raw strings to send and receive messages.
If you are looking for how to generate the ssl files please take a look at [tools/ssl](https://github.com/reapler/radrpc/tree/master/tools/ssl).
